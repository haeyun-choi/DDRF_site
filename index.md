In this paper, we propose DeepDeblurRF, a novel radiance field deblurring approach that can synthesize high-quality novel views from blurred training views with significantly reduced training time. DeepDeblurRF leverages deep neural network (DNN)-based deblurring modules to enjoy their deblurring performance and computational efficiency. To effectively combine DNN-based deblurring and radiance field construction, we propose a novel radiance field (RF)guided deblurring and an iterative framework that performs RF-guided deblurring and radiance field construction in an alternating manner. Moreover, DeepDeblurRF is compatible with various scene representations, such as voxel grids and 3D Gaussians, expanding its applicability. We also present BlurRF-Synth, the first large-scale synthetic dataset for training radiance field deblurring frameworks. We conduct extensive experiments on both camera motion blur and defocus blur, demonstrating that DeepDeblurRF achieves state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis quality with significantly reduced training time.

## DeepDeblurRF
DeepDeblurRF takes a set of blurred images of a scene and estimates a sharp radiance field that can synthesize a sharp novel view given an arbitrary pose.
![Framework](/static/image/framework.png)

To do so,
- Performs initial deblurring on the input blurred images.
- Estimates the camera poses of the deblurred images.
- Constructs a radiance field to aggregate 3D information and renders images from the same camera poses as the deblurred images.
- Leverages rendered images to obtain updated deblurred images from the input blurred images, a process referred to as RF-guided deblurring.
- Iteratively performs **RF construction** using deblurred images and **RF-guided deblurring** to gradually enhance the quality of the radiance field and the deblurred images.
- At the last iteration, we perform only the RF construction step and obtain a final radiance field, from which we can synthesize sharp novel views.

As iterations progress, the rendered images contain high-quality scene information, which subsequently improves the RF-guided deblurring network's performance in the next iteration.

## BlurRF Dataset
The ***BlurRF-Synth*** dataset is the first large-scale multi-view dataset for radiance field deblurring approaches, reflecting real-world camera degradations such as noise, saturated pixels, and in-camera processing artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce ***BlurRF-Real***, a real-world dataset for evaluation in low-light conditions where blur often occurs.

## Background
The paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.

## Objective
Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.


## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
